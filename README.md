# Welcome to My Data Analysis Portfolio!

This repository showcases my data analysis projects. Below is an overview of the included files and their purposes.

## Project: Flight Delays Analysis

**File:** `Flight_Delays.ipynb`  
This Jupyter Notebook contains my Python code for cleaning a dataset of flight delays sourced from Kaggle. The code processes the raw data and generates a new CSV file for visualization.

**Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - Flight Delays](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahoora00135/flights)

## Visualizations

To explore the visualizations created using the processed data, please visit my Tableau Public workbook:
